  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {What is the most robust way to communicate flow trajectories? To answer this question, we employ two neural networks to respectively deconstruct (the encoder) and reconstruct (the decoder) trajectories, where information is passed between the two networks through a low-dimensional latent space in a set-up known as an autoencoder. To ensure that their communications are robust, we add noise to the coded information passed through this latent space. In the low-noise limit the latent space structures are non-spatial in nature, resembling modes of a principle component analysis (PCA). However, as the signal-to-noise ratio is decreased, we uncover Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) as the most compact representations which still allow the decoder to accurately reconstruct trajectories. This relationship offers increased interpretability to both PCA and LCS analysis, and helps to bridge the gap between two methods of flow analysis.},

abstract = {Scale decomposition is ubiquitous in the analysis of complex fluid flows. Often with an eye towards reduced order modeling, considerable effort has been invested in the development of novel sets of basis functions for such decompositions. The most successful sets of basis functions have been developed in the Eulerian perspective, where traditional tools of calculus and newer methods from data science can be most easily leveraged. Here, we take advantage of recent interest in graph-based approaches to Lagrangian coherence as well as new methods for the scale analysis of complex networks to introduce a new scale decomposition that is instead fully Lagrangian and based on transport. To do so, we adapt a technique from network science know as the graph Fourier transform and develop a novel graph correlation function that allows us to quantitatively describe our Lagrangian decomposition as a function of scale. This method allows better interpretability of the dynamic consequences of kinematic coherence as well as the ability to perform traditional Eulerian tasks (such as decomposition, filtering, and compression) on Lagrangian quantities. We illustrate our techniques on examples drawn from coherent-structure analysis, ocean mixing, and cloud physics.},

abstract = {The Pi Chamber is a cloud chamber at Michigan Technological University that utilizes moist turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard flow between two temperature-controlled, saturated plates to create cloud conditions in a controlled laboratory setting. This experimental apparatus has been the source of numerous scientific studies but also offers an advantageous platform with which to test numerical modeling approaches. In this study, the primary goal is to use direct numerical simulation (DNS) with Lagrangian aerosol/droplet microphysics to recreate, as realistically as possible, the conditions inside the Pi Chamber. The biggest discrepancies between the DNS and laboratory setups are the Rayleigh number (Ra=7.9×106 in the DNS) and the use of periodic lateral boundary conditions. Nonetheless, numerical experiments are conducted for two published Pi Chamber cases: steady aerosol injection and the resulting statistically steady-state cloud and transient conditions when aerosol injection is shut off. Generally speaking, the DNS is able to capture many of the salient features observed in the Pi Chamber experiments, both qualitatively and quantitatively, including microphysical details and influences on the fluctuating ambient saturation in the chamber. From the DNS, Lagrangian statistics are interrogated which are otherwise inaccessible from the experimental view. In particular, the supersaturation fluctuations seen by droplets are observed to deviate from a Gaussian distribution - a common assumption in stochastic modeling - and the probability distribution of droplet lifetime does not adhere to the expected behavior assuming solid particles settling in a quiescent medium.},
