# Research goals

I'm really excited about applying mechanistic interpretability tools to AI physics models. Data-driven weather models are the best example of successfull AI at scale in a physics context, so working on those currently. Also the atmosphere is cool. Previously, I've done work in turbulence, cloud modeling, coherent structures, nonlinear dynamics, and some general stats stuff.
